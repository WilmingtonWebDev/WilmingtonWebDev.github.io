Tom spends most of his time writing Python or defining build pipelines in Jenkins and trying to automate _all the things_  for [MediaGamma](http://mediagamma.com/) a London based _data science_ startup.
He started off building websites, writing Javascript, and wrangling css first for a startup called _Metric_ and then building production tools for [The Moving Picture Company](http://www.moving-picture.com/).
